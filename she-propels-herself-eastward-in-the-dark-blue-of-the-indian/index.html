<p>She propels herself eastward in the dark blue of the Indian Ocean, along the western lip of the Great Australian Bight. Cruising at ten miles per hour, three hundred feet below sea level, the eight foot southern bluefin tuna has not stopped moving since her birth thirty years ago. Her ventilation system requires that water be pushed through her gaping mouth and over her gills to provide her long muscles with oxygen. The faster she swims, the more oxygen her giant body reaps: a feedback system that makes it nearly impossible for any sardine to escape.</p><p>It being the end of the southern summer, this tuna has just left a pocket of the Indian Ocean nestled between Indonesia and Australia, where she would had delivered up to 15 million eggs. This expanse of ocean is the sole known spawning grounds for the southern bluefin, yet it remains unknown how many years will pass before she spawns again.</p><p>While it is easy to get lost in the strength and beauty of the bluefin tuna, the 2014 reality of this nomadic fish is one painted with overfishing, false statistics, and losing regulation. The International Union for Conservation of Nature currently categorizes the southern bluefin as critically endangered, and its Atlantic cousin as endangered.</p><p>Realizing a persistent drop in the annual catch of southern bluefin, it was Australia, Japan and New Zealand who imposed the first limits on their tuna fishermen in 1985. In 1993, these three countries formed the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT), naming their primary objective the “conservation and optimum utilisation of the global SBT fishery”.</p><p>With the seemingly opposing goals of ‘conservation’ and ‘optimum utilisation’ of the southern bluefin, the CCSBT seeks to strike a sustainable balance by imposing annual ‘total allowable catch’ (TAC) limits upon fishermen from each cooperating nation. The global TAC for 2014 is 12,449 tonnes, a quantity significantly less than a global catch that reached 40,000 tonnes in the 1980s, and 80,000 tonnes in the 1960s .</p><p>How do fishermen adjust to these limits? They under-report their catch.</p><p>While there is comfort in regulating allowable catch limits for this critically endangered species, there seem to be few taking it seriously. The global market demand and ensuing payout are so great that southern bluefin fishermen deem them worth breaking the rules. In 2008, Japan alone consumed nearly 19,400 tonnes of southern bluefin tuna, which equates to 170% of the global reported catch for the same year.</p><p>The CCSBT is well aware of the overfishing but has difficulty identifying both its gravity and how to prevent it. Each member nation is in charge of keeping their annual catch under TAC, as well as ensuring fisherman compliance with the reporting process. Yet, as every year’s global reported catch falls right around, if not underneath, the prescribed TAC – the true catch numbers remain far greater.</p><p>The CCSBT combats the overfishing of southern bluefin with strategies ranging from catch audits and mandatory satellite monitoring of vessels, to the tracking of the trade data in international markets. Fish farms and large fishing boats must be authorized by the commission, and handoffs between carriers at sea must be chaperoned by a CCSBT observer.</p><p>It is not as though these are weak alternatives for reducing overfishing; it’s the immense scale of the tuna fishing industry that makes their objective so difficult. National Geographic estimates that the world is currently consuming 7.4 million tonnes of tuna. With the southern bluefin’s territory spanning across the globe’s southern oceans, and ports and marinas densely dotting all coasts, keeping an eye on all tuna fishing activity is nearly impossible.</p><p>There is no questioning the world’s affinity for tuna – and while we cannot assume that the world will ever stop eating this fish all together, there is still room to push for wiser consumption decisions. This is the angle taken on by organizations like the Monterey Bay Aquarium and National Geographic.</p><p>The Monterey Bay Aquarium’s Seafood Watch program was designed to educate consumers and businesses on choices that will maintain a healthy standard for oceans. According to the Seafood Watch, all bluefin tuna fall into the “avoid” category. This marker was set not only in an attempt to encourage the species’ sustainability, but also as the result of health advisories concerning high levels of mercury found in older, larger bluefin tuna.</p><p>The Seafood Watch also offers a free, regularly updated pocket guide that identifies the best and worst alternatives for sustainable seafood consumption. The latest guide recommends eating albacore, skipjack, and yellowfin varieties of tuna, especially those fished by Canadian and US boats that use the trolling or pole methods.</p><p></p><p>While the creation and enforcement of fishing regulation is out of the everyday consumer’s hands, the demand that stems overfishing is not. Something as simple as increased interest and awareness in the type of tuna we eat can make the job of the CCSBT a lot easier, and can give the southern bluefin population the opportunity to reach a level of comfort.</p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-black colors-local " data-reactid="13"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="14"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="15"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="16"><span data-reactid="17"><!-- react-empty: 18 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="19"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="20"></a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="21"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="22"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="23"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
